        The online world has become a global universal medium for nearly all information we consume (for internet usage statistics, see Figures 1–4). It has subsumed previous technological advancements such as television, radio, printing press, mail,
        weather forecast, clock, calculator any other thinkable technology of the not-so-distant past. These individual technologies are now consumed in a layered, unified environment of open windows, digital chimes, blinking ads and popping
        notifications. Since information online is often compressed and designed to be as attention-grabbing, clickable and shareable as possible, our brain also learns to absorb it in a different way — quickly, superficially and horizontally. This
        crucial relationship between the medium and the message was already introduced by Marshall McLuhan in his seminal text “Medium Is The Message” (McLuhan 1). Due to the ubiquity of portable smart devices and internet-of-things (IoT) in our
        homes and public spaces, the algorithmic way of experiencing the world becomes ever more prevalent. We increasingly externalize our thinking and decision-making power to the computer, gradually making the uncomputable the unthinkable,
        hindering our imagination beyond the realm of computation.
        <br><br>
        Over the past years I have become increasingly aware of the alienating effects of a hyperconnected life on the mind. Like a computer infected by a virus, thoughts enter the awareness like unwanted popups, flooding the operation system with
        constant interruptions. It’s like someone has been messing with the mind’s system preferences making the interface harder and harder to operate. The back-end of the mind is rendered opaque, while the front-end is coded incomprehensible. The
        routing of the brain gets more and more complex since it constantly connects to an increasing amount of networks, devices and communication channels. Floating on the surface of this ungraspable network, the disoriented and hyperstimulated
        brain often resorts to the reactions of the so-called “lizard brain,” that governs functions such as primitive emotional responses, habit-formation, fighting, fleeing, feeding and reproduction (Komninos).
        <br><br>
        Processing the continuous flow of requests, alerts and reminders at maximum power, the mind can at its best enter a temporary sleep mode, but is never truly allowed to shut down (see Figure 5). The distinction between work and leisure, fact
        and fiction, dreams and reality becomes ever more obsolete in the age of persuasive artificial intelligence (AI), fake news and deepfakes. Like being attached to the strings of a puppeteer, our thoughts, emotions and actions are being
        sophisticatedly tailored into the needs of neoliberal capitalism. In the name of profit and efficiency, the morally neutral AIs sow polarized views, disinformation, hate speech and primitive emotions in society, while harvesting our time and
        attention for the economic benefit of a few multinational corporations and increasing financial inequality across the globe. International data monopolies have become one of the most powerful institutions of the world, holding significant
        bio- and neuropower over global populations.
        <br><br>
        Together the five American tech giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Inc., Microsoft and Facebook earn almost the total gross-domestic product (GDP) of Netherlands, leaving behind other rich countries like Switzerland and Saudi Arabia, making them
        economically more powerful than most nations of the world (“Most Valuable Companies In The World – 2020”).
        <br><br>
        The idea that our thoughts, feelings and desires could be controlled without our awareness used to sound like science fiction. Today, it has become a reality, backed up with a body of research claiming that machine intelligence affects human
        decision-making beyond the level of self-awareness. The more sophisticated our machine learning algorithms become, the less we understand how they really work. What we do know, is that the reasoning of the machine greatly differs from that of
        humans.

        My own awakening to the issues of attention economy was ignited during my university studies in business and economics, where I completed a bachelor’s degree in Business Technology and a master’s degree in Information and Service Management.
        Questions related to information technology and economics followed me into my creative practice and eventually inspired me to write this thesis. I wanted compare my personal experiences of living within attention economy to the existing body
        of research relating to its effects on society and the individual. Triggered by my own experiences, I set out to investigate what exactly is going on in our hyperconnected minds and paralyzed bodies. I wanted to understand what embedded
        values and working mechanisms are hidden behind the slick user interface screens. I hoped to discover ways to decolonize the brain from the grasp of the attention economy and to find out if there’s a way to realign the goals of technology
        with the goals of human life.
