        <p>The world has become a global universal medium for nearly all information we consume (for internet usage statistics, see <b>figures1–4</b>. It has subsumed previous technological advancements such as television, radio, printing press,
          mail,
          weather forecast, clock, calculator any other thinkable technology of the not-so-distant past. These individual technologies are now consumed in a layered, unified environment of open windows, digital chimes, blinking ads and popping
          notifications. Since information online is often compressed and designed to be as attention-grabbing, clickable and shareable as possible, our brain also learns to absorb it in a different way — quickly, superficially and horizontally. This
          crucial relationship between the medium and the message was already introduced by Marshall McLuhan in his seminal text “Medium Is The Message”.<sup>1</sup> Due to the ubiquity of portable smart devices and internet-of-things (IoT) in our
          homes and public spaces, the algorithmic way of experiencing the world becomes ever more prevalent. We increasingly externalize our thinking and decision-making power to the computer, gradually making the uncomputable the unthinkable,
          hindering our imagination beyond the realm of computation.

          <br>
          Over the past years I have become increasingly aware of the alienating effects of a hyperconnected life on the mind. Like a computer infected by a virus, thoughts enter the awareness like unwanted popups, flooding the operation system with
          constant interruptions. It’s like someone has been messing with the mind’s system preferences making the interface harder and harder to operate. The back-end of the mind is rendered opaque, while the front-end is coded incomprehensible. The
          routing of the brain gets more and more complex since it constantly connects to an increasing amount of networks, devices and communication channels. Floating on the surface of this ungraspable network, the disoriented and hyperstimulated
          brain often resorts to the reactions of the so-called “lizard brain,” that governs functions such as primitive emotional responses, habit-formation, fighting, fleeing, feeding and reproduction.<sup>2</sup>
          <br><br>
          Processing the continuous flow of requests, alerts and reminders at maximum power, the mind can at its best enter a temporary sleep mode, but is never truly allowed to shut down <b>figure5</b>. The distinction between work and leisure, fact
          and fiction, dreams and reality becomes ever more obsolete in the age of persuasive artificial intelligence (AI), fake news and deepfakes. Like being attached to the strings of a puppeteer, our thoughts, emotions and actions are being
          sophisticatedly tailored into the needs of neoliberal capitalism. In the name of profit and efficiency, the morally neutral AIs sow polarized views, disinformation, hate speech and primitive emotions in society, while harvesting our time
          and
          attention for the economic benefit of a few multinational corporations and increasing financial inequality across the globe. International data monopolies have become one of the most powerful institutions of the world, holding significant
          bio- and neuropower over global populations.
          <br><br>
          Together the five American tech giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Inc., Microsoft and Facebook earn almost the total gross-domestic product (GDP) of Netherlands, leaving behind other rich countries like Switzerland and Saudi Arabia, making
          them
          economically more powerful than most nations of the world.<sup>3</sup>
          <br><br>
          The idea that our thoughts, feelings and desires could be controlled without our awareness used to sound like science fiction. Today, it has become a reality, backed up with a body of research claiming that machine intelligence affects
          human
          decision-making beyond the level of self-awareness. The more sophisticated our machine learning algorithms become, the less we understand how they really work. What we do know, is that the reasoning of the machine greatly differs from that
          of
          humans.
          <br><br>
          My own awakening to the issues of attention economy was ignited during my university studies in business and economics, where I completed a bachelor’s degree in Business Technology and a master’s degree in Information and Service
          Management.
          Questions related to information technology and economics followed me into my creative practice and eventually inspired me to write this thesis. I wanted compare my personal experiences of living within attention economy to the existing
          body
          of research relating to its effects on society and the individual. Triggered by my own experiences, I set out to investigate what exactly is going on in our hyperconnected minds and paralyzed bodies. I wanted to understand what embedded
          values and working mechanisms are hidden behind the slick user interface screens. I hoped to discover ways to decolonize the brain from the grasp of the attention economy and to find out if there’s a way to realign the goals of technology
          with the goals of human life.

      <p class="subheading">Affects of a Hyperconnected Lifestyle on an Individual</p>
      <br>
      <p>Most of us have at least occasionally felt overwhelmed by life in the 21st century attention economy. Attention economy refers to the current state of the economy, where companies are increasingly competing for users’ attention, which has
        become the most valuable resource of the digital age.
        <sup>4</sup> In today’s society information is abundant, but attention is scarce, which makes the modern economy increasingly revolve around the human attention span. Companies spend increasing
        efforts in finding ways how to best capture our attention for the generation of profit. An apt visualization of the complexities of living in the age of attention economy and social media can be seen in the film “Possessed,” directed
        Metahaven
        and Rob Schröder <b>figure6</b>.
        <br><br>
        The hyperconnected lifestyle results in a lack of focus, rest and self-awareness while the mind resorts to a whirlwind of superficial thinking — favoring speed over contemplation, broadness over depth and simplicity over complexity. Behavior
        often seems to be dictated by subconscious compulsive urges instead of considerate, mindful actions. Technology used to be our tool, but it’s now our environment. It’s our identity and self-value, our knowledge and memory, our work and our
        leisure, our dream and our nightmare.
        <br><br>
        It’s a constant love-hate relationship, where the platforms that bring us visibility, work and valuable contacts also distract us every minute of the day. The online world makes it terribly easy to drift away by meaningless entertainment,
        providing a steady flow of shockingly accurate personalized content, hitting the sweet spot of our most private desires. And while it occasionally produces feelings of success and self-validation, it also produces the most intense feelings of
        failure, loneliness and anxiety, leaving us confused of what exactly feels off. It’s a constant ping-pong match between emotional extremes, where our attention, mood and behavior are tossed around by forces that we seem to have little control
        of.
        <br><br>
        We feel the need to stay connected in order to prove our position in the world, since not participating feels like not fully existing. We escape our fear of being “out” by trying to constantly keep up with global trends and flows of
        information, but it is precisely this fear that keeps us logging in and scrolling until eternity, preventing us from standing still and observing our behavior from an outside perspective. But one can never keep up since by design,
        hyperconnectedness makes us feel on the verge of dropping out. The detrimental role of social media for mental health has been much explored in pop culture, such as in the semi-autobiographical television series <i>I May Destroy You</i>
        (2020) by
        Michaela Coel <b>figure7</b> and the biographical documentary <i>This Is Paris</i> (2020) by Paris Hilton <b>figure8</b>.
        <br><br>
        The hyperconnected lifestyle extends itself also beyond mindless social media scrolling. Being the perfect example of a 21st century international freelancer, I operate between multiple countries, time-zones and industries, with a majority of
        my work being initiated and executed in or via an online environment. The gig economy has made working contracts and conditions flexible but at the same time precarious. Workers are increasingly expected to be always on call waiting for the
        next assignment, working globally on multiple time zones without fixed working hours, creating a “24/7 work-day”.
        <sup>5</sup>
        <br><br>
        The experience of time becomes almost “instantaneous,” consisting of inconceivably brief and fragmented instants where the fast-paced, non-linear social and technological relationships replace the linear logic of clock-time.
        <sup>6</sup> Sense of
        time and space mend into an nonrhythmic pulsation where on one end huge chunks of time are getting sucked into online wormholes, and on the other end time slows down in the moments of insomnia or in the face of a focus-intensive task such as
        in-depth reading or writing.
        <br><br>
        Like Pascal Gielen aptly described: “In a corporate world, society is losing its time to dig deep. Not obstinacy, stubbornness and steadfastness, but adaptability, flexibility and mobility allow people to survive in a global network
        configuration. Today, we have to take the witticism ‘Time is Money’ literally. Time is no longer determined by a place or a local polis, but by virtual money flows which stream in high speed around the globe. This leads to the speeding-up of
        fast changing connections, in which we not only lose depth, but also height. Consequently, having ‘no time’ means that you don’t have the time to stand still by yourself. Time for (self)reflectivity is shrinking, also the time to stand above
        yourself, looking at yourself while you operate in the world”.
        <sup>7</sup>
        <br><br>
        In the competition of everyday life, consideration of the long-term consequences of one’s actions gets pushed to the back of the mind. People are forced into a situation where they are responsible only for themselves and their own survival.
        The
        responsibility for one’s immediate environment and social context simply becomes dysfunctional for one must continuously move, either mentally or physically, in order to survive. The rare occasion of simply doing nothing results in anxiety,
        boredom and restlessness, since every waking moment feels like another opportunity for personal development.
        <br><br>
        With part-time and freelance employment on the rise, the labile working culture makes individuals disengaged from solidarity structures and makes it difficult for them to stand up for their rights for humane working conditions. In an economy
        where attention is the most valuable asset, the freelancer is often forced to exchange work for mere exposure. These freelancers and other post-Fordist workers have to resort to short-term thinking, as they are obliged to quickly, flexibly
        and
        opportunistically anticipate the constantly changing and unpredictable working environment. This makes the neoliberal freelancer fall on the mercy of the here-and-now, making it impossible to attain any long-term perspective.

      <p class="subheading"> The biggest psychological experiment ever run on humanity</p>
      <br>
      <p>I believe our dogmatic belief in free human will might be the biggest mistake we are making in the 21st century. We are a society stuck on an outdated 18th century Enlightenment philosophy, where “free” human will was seen as the source of
        all
        truth. In the light of new science, we know how the most primitive parts of our brain can be effectively persuaded to act on a pre-programmed impulse.
        <sup>8</sup> Since our impulsive reactions ignite deep in the brain below the surface our
        cognition, we are mostly unaware of our behavior being manipulated.
        <br><br>
        The new persuasive technologies have raised a concern of how they will affect our thinking, our attentional capacities, our emotions and our behavior. 40 years from the popularisation of the personal computer and 13 years from the release of
        the first iPhone, we are now living in the midst of a transformation comparable to the magnitude of the industrial revolution. The information revolution has demonstrated its immense power of shaping our lives and our minds. Due to the great
        freedom and power of the tech companies combined with little regulation, the information revolution has become the most extensive psychological experiment ever run on humanity. Attention-grabbing persuasive technology is creating an
        unprecedented force of bio- and psychopower that neurologically captures an entire generation’s attention through the means of neuromarketing that aims to interfere with the consumers’ decision-making processes <b>figure9</b>.

        Before shifting up our gears to the next level of machine intelligence and automated cognition, it’s of utmost urgency to investigate our current relationship with technology. The hazardous business models must be eliminated in order to steer
        away from the abusive path we have recently strayed upon. Regaining agency in our decision-making processes, remastering our focus and rediscovering values beyond eternal growth, efficiency and productivity must become the main goals of

      <p class="subheading">Technology, psychology and neuroscience harnessed against us</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our need for social feedback makes it easy for tech companies to harness this psychological necessity for the creation of profit. Subjugated to the brain’s reward mechanisms, it’s difficult for us to resist the urge to spend time on our
        devices. Neuroscience has shown how our dopamine and serotonin release can be triggered, which makes us return to our devices like a gambling addict to a slot machine. In fact, both are built with the simple-but-addictive mechanism of
        frequently checking for “wins,” be it money or likes, that give us our hit of habit-forming feel-good hormones.
        <br><br>
        Behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner found already in the 1930s that rats and pigeons could be trained to repeat certain behavior based on punishment and reward see <b>figure10</b>.
        <sup>9</sup> He also found out that they responded most frequently to reward-associated stimuli when the reward was received in an unpredictable manner. As long as the effort for checking for rewards is not too big, rats — and humans — will
        end up checking for rewards habitually. This knowledge from behavioral psychology is utilized by slot machines and social media algorithms alike. Instagram’s algorithm enforces engagement by using the brain’s reward mechanisms and their
        pattern-enforcing abilities. When receiving a sudden reward after an initially negative outcome, our brain responds to the surprising reward stronger than it would respond to a continuous flow of small rewards. This is why Instagram sometimes
        withholds likes to produce an initial disappointment, only to be rewarded with a big amount of likes later. This trains users to check their phones often in the hope of an unexpected sudden reward.
        <sup>10</sup>
        <br><br>
        Our reward mechanisms are tuned into grasping anything that makes us feel good, not necessarily what is good for us. Social media provides large quantities of easily accessible hyperstimulating activities that trigger the reward mechanisms of
        the brain. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter and a hormone, is not only involved in making us feel good, but it also tends to reinforce behavior and restructure brain-circuits so that we are more likely to engage in dopamine-releasing behavior
        over and over again.<sup>11</sup> If we wish to shift the way our brain works, the first step is always through changing our behavior that ultimately transforms the architecture of our brains.
        <sup>12</sup>
        <br><br>
        Although dopamine is closely related to our brain’s reward mechanisms, it’s too simple to call dopamine a “feel-good” hormone. In fact, the precise role of dopamine in the brain is still partly unclear, but we know it participates in several
        functions related to motivation, willingness of putting effort into reaching goals and gaining rewards see <b>figure11</b>.
        <sup>13</sup> Dopamine behaves in the brain like any other substance — the more often we engage in dopamine-releasing behavior the more motivated we are to seek out for increasing quantities of that behavior, needing ever-higher doses of
        stimulation in order to achieve the same level of satisfaction. Unlike one might think, neurological research shows that humans alongside with other mammals form their essential relationship to their environment not by obtaining food or
        engaging in other life-maintaining activities, but rather by extracting sensory stimulation from their environment to modify mood and body states.
        <sup>14</sup> This makes psychotropic activity the main biological imperative that societies are driven by. Eating food, just like getting likes on Instagram, becomes an activity of mood-modification through the release of dopamine in the
        brain, making us prone to re-engage in this behavior.
        <br><br>
        This compelling biological drive for pursuing sensory stimulation is used by tech companies who design machine learning algorithms to feed our craving for mood-altering stimuli. We spiral into compulsive, dopamine-fuelled interaction with
        social platforms, where the commercially driven algorithms mostly pursue one fundamental goal: to maximize the amount of time spent on the platform.
        <sup>15</sup> More time spent equals more data, and more data equals more money from advertisers who wish to benefit from interfering in our decision-making processes.
        <br><br>
        Like said in the 2020 Netflix documentary “The Social Dilemma” <b>figure12</b>: “If you are not paying for the product, you are the product.”
        <sup>16</sup> And it’s not because anyone is evil or has bad intentions. It’s because there’s an economical incentive to get our attention at all costs, which ultimately becomes a race to the bottom of the brainstem — a race to the most
        primitive emotions that grab our attention the easiest <b>figure15</b>. A world ruled by our most primitive emotions is hardly a world anyone wants to live in, especially when we know that negative emotions such as fear and anger make a
        bigger and thus more profitable impact than their positive counterparts.
        <sup>17</sup>
        <br><br>
        A study by Gloria Mark at the University of California shows that on average it takes us a whopping 23 minutes to refocus after any interruption.
        <sup>18</sup> The same study shows that the more we get interrupted the more we become conditioned to interrupt ourselves, which we do on average in every 3.5 minutes.
        <sup>19</sup> It has been shown that heavy multitaskers perform worse in various cognitive tests than people who multitask less.
        <sup>20</sup> Paradoxically, multitaskers are also less capable of switching between tasks compared to the infrequent multitaskers.
        <sup>21</sup>
        <br><br>
        A typical person checks their phone every 15 minutes or less, and half of the time there is no alert or notification to trigger this action.
        <sup>22</sup> This happens because putting down our phone produces a stress hormone called cortisol in the brain that triggers a fight-or-flight response. This response gave us the ability to be hyper-aware and quickly shift our focus from
        one thing to another, which used to be crucial for our survival in order to not be eaten by predators or not to bypass a source of food in our immediate surroundings. Now, the same hormonal response makes us pointlessly hyper-aware and eager
        to know whether we’ve got new likes in social media. The impulsion to relieve us from this cortisol-induced anxiety is the underlying reason why we compulsively check our phones.
        <sup>23</sup>
        <br><br>
        Every medium develops some cognitive skills at the expense of others. While screen-based media has strengthened our visual-spatial intelligence, it has also diminished some of our higher order cognitive-processes, such as critical thinking,
        inductive problem solving, imagination, reflection, abstract vocabulary and mindfulness.
        <sup>24</sup> At birth we are born with an overabundance of unassigned synapses, waiting for interaction with the environment to connect them into functioning circuits producing new behavior patterns and knowledge while the inactive synapses
        get gradually eliminated. The development of the brain in the post-natal period is a neurological Darwinian selection process that defines the most crucial functions for the rest of the life.
        <br><br>
        Even at adulthood our brains are populated with adjustable nervous elements and synapses whose function are yet to be determined.
        <sup>25</sup> This population forms the possibility for brain plasticity, adjusting itself based on its interaction with the culture milieu. The neural elements most in sync with the environment get amplified, while the least synchronized
        ones fade away, gradually reshaping the architecture of the brain.
        <sup>26</sup> In the long run, the occurrence of variance in the brain results in gradual emergence of traits in the evolution of the brain and the whole species over generations. This is also called the “Baldwin effect,” in which change
        occurring in an organism as a result of its interaction with its environment becomes gradually assimilated into its developmental genetic repertoire.
        <sup>27</sup>
        <br><br>
        Online platforms have introduced a significant new culture milieu that contributes to the subsequent brain development across the world. Since the most popular online environments are produced by a few international data monopolies, we
        inevitably shift towards a more unified global culture where the offline environment dances to the tireless machinic beat of the online world. The huge influence of the environment to our brain development gives significant bio- and
        neuropower to the owners and designers of the most prevalent digital environments that people around the world interact with on a daily basis.

      <p class="subheading">Psychopathologies of Cognitive Capitalism</p>
      <p>In addition to the milder symptoms such as lack of focus, shallow thinking, stress and insomnia, certain distinct mental health disorders have become more prevalent in society, such as attention deficit disorder (ADD), autism, panic attacks,
        depression, anxiety disorder and burnout.<sup>28, 29</sup> On one hand these psychopathologies are triggered by the experience of living in a phase of capitalism where the individual has to live with the anxieties and stress of continuously
        adapting and readapting to the accelerated pace of new developments, while also dealing with the paranoia of constant surveillance <b>figure14</b> and uncertain, precarious and possibly lonely working conditions. On the other hand they are a
        product of a feeling of alienation due to the neurobiological incapability of the brain to adapt to the accelerated pace of cultural plasticity and change.<sup>30</sup> The lack of adequate perceptual and cognitive processing of the
        environment causes distress on the individual. Some neurologists see especially mild forms of these psychopathologies as a normative process of brain plasticity that opens windows to alternative creativity and understanding that eventually
        reshapes the brain to be more suited for its environment.<sup>31, 32</sup> The era-specific psychopathologies paint a picture of how our bodies and minds attempt to cope with our environment.
        <br><br>
        In the neoliberal world, available pharmaceuticals can make us wake up, fall asleep, boost performance, cope with stress, battle depression, flatten out mood swings and relieve us from the pain caused by non-mobility and unergonomic working
        conditions. While advancements in medicine bring undeniable benefits, they also raise a concern of how far we should psychotropically transform our natural state in order to fulfil the demands of ultimate performance. One cannot help but
        wonder whether the normalization of daily psychotropical medication ultimately leads towards a society of unified and normalized human beings, similar to that envisioned by Aldous Huxley in his cult classic novel <i>Brave New World</i>
        published in 1932, where laboratory-conceived and conditioned humans receive their salary as a happiness-inducing drug called “soma” that keeps society peaceful and content, but also makes people incapable of questioning the society around
        them <b>figure15</b>.

      <p class="subheading">Cosmetic Psychopharmacology</p>
      <p>Some say that due to the popularization of different mood and performance-enhancing drugs, we have entered an era of “cosmetic psychopharmacology”<sup>33</sup> where medicine extends beyond curing illness <b>figure16</b>. Albeit responding
        to real human
        desires, cosmetic psychopharmacology also medicalizes aspects of normal human existence and treats existential questions as biochemical problems. If a biochemical drug makes people happy, can we derive that sadness is a biochemical
        dysfunction that should be treated? If people are unable to perform under high pressure and unreasonable workload, should this be fixed with a performance-enhancing pill <b>figure16, figure17</b>? If one’s life feels empty within the
        framework of
        consumerism, treating this emptiness as an illness goes beside the point. On the contrary, a medically induced contentedness may prevent us from feeling the perhaps necessary unease of facing the consequences of our lifestyle on the planet.
        <br><br>
        The need that cosmetic psychopharmacology ultimately responds to, is the need to live up to society’s idea of a dignified and successful life. We all live within a certain framework of understanding that gives purpose to our actions. This
        framework, which correlates with the values of the society where one lives in, gives an understanding of what counts as a good life and what counts as a failure.<sup>34</sup> It shows what kind of life is worth living, and most importantly,
        what kind of
        a life provides purpose and meaning. Before, people worried about losing their honour, disobeying God or displeasing their ancestors. Now, people question whether there even exists a framework worth believing in. This uncertainty produces a
        novel feeling of psychological discomfort — a certain sense of emptiness, absurdity, vertigo and malaise.
        <br><br>
        Leading a meaningful and authentic life has become the central purpose for Western contemporary humans. Within the framework provided by neoliberal ideology, a meaningful life is achieved and the authentic self is discovered by pursuing a
        career, where the concept of work ultimately transforms into a moral quest for self-fulfilment. For the moral quest of happiness, social media becomes the perfect performance platform and a public proof of a happy and successful life. Like
        Elliott aptly wrote: “If you are unhappy or find life unfulfilling, there is something wrong with you, and not only should you pursue happiness, you should pursue it aggressively. Why? Because if you don’t you will be letting yourself down.
        You will be wasting the time you have on this earth. And if that means taking Prozac, so be it. In this way happiness is not just your right; it’s your duty.”<sup>35</sup>

      <div class="subheading">attention economy and the brain</div>
      <p> While we have been busy pursuing our careers, shopping
        and performing happiness online, AI-empowered attention economy has become the prevailing power structure of the 21st century, where the brain is the new factory, behavior modification is the new business model and attention is the new
        currency. In the name of profit, companies have increasing incentives to monitor and streamline our brain activity, simultaneously eliminating contingency from our behavior in order to improve predictability.
        <br><br>
        Attention economy has harnessed machine learning, databasing, pattern matching, searching and querying to the mission of governing the brain, reaching out to the unconscious levels of cognition and laying claims of what we should be thinking,
        feeling and doing. Already in the 1960s the known media theorist Marshall McLuhan predicted the commercial grab of our senses: “Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to
        benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don’t really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like giving
        the earth’s atmosphere to a company as a monopoly.”<sup>36</sup>
        <br><br>
        The two main players in the Western AI development, Google and Facebook, are increasingly expanding their business towards neural network-driven approaches. In 2020, Google published the largest-ever map of brain connectivity, tracing 20
        million synapses and connecting 25 000 neurons in the brain of a fly <b>figure18</b>. The goal is to one day be able to map the full connectivity of the human brain. Since long, Google has drifted away from simply providing search results to
        providing accurate user profiles and behavior predictions. Likes, clicks, recommendations and loose privacy settings all aim to gain a better understanding of what we might want to think before we actually think it. As the former Google CEO
        Eric Schmidt said already in 2010: “I actually think most people don’t want Google to answer their questions […]. They want Google to tell them what they should be doing next.”<sup>37</sup>
        <br><br>
        Since the prefrontal cortex governs the processes related to attention, prediction and working memory,<sup>38</sup> it becomes a crucial target of the attention economy. Being the last lobe to evolve in the brain, it sits at the top of the
        hierarchy of
        modulating incoming information according to previous knowledge and expectations, enforcing already learned ways of seeing and responding to the world.<sup>39</sup> Due to this confirmation bias, people have a tendency to discount information
        that
        undermines their past knowledge, choices and judgements.<sup>40</sup>
        <br><br>
        Similarly, the problem with AI is that it assumes that the future is always like the past. By suggesting new content based on previous behavior, confirmation bias emerges in online echo chambers that by design enforce our existing opinions
        and beliefs. At large this can lead to polarized opinions, divided nations and to a so-called “post-truth” society, where objective facts become less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to personal belief and emotion.

      <div class="subheading">The Dawn of Dynamic Logic and Nonconscious Cognition</div>
      <p>In attention economy a hidden paradox exists: the colonization of intelligence has been coupled with the explosion of precognitive decision-making — a process of total appropriation of thinking on behalf of capital.<sup>41</sup> Nonconscious cognition
        surpasses conscious deductive reasoning in order to accelerate solution-finding, being a central element in the automated information architecture of today’s communication technologies. In the means of efficiency, these anticipatory
        computational systems influence our gut feeling instead of our higher intellect in order to speed up the process of decision-making and thus the accumulation of capital. When interacting with these systems, our behavior is ruled by
        precognitive decision-making that subconsciously steers our desires and attention, blurring the distinction between automation and autonomy. The neural turn in attention economy makes the affective way of directing and programming human
        response absolutely central. In a speculative, futuristic video artwork <i>What The Heart Wants</i> from 2016, Cécile B. Evans contemplates the topical question of what it means to be a human in a technology-driven world where software, hardware and
        consciousness merge together <b>figure19</b>.
        <br><br>
        Affective technocapitalism has already entered the zone where automated machine intelligence and nonconscious cognitive processes—used by humans, animals and machines alike—challenge the power of human intelligence and consciousness. The
        deterministic vision of human intelligence which sees all behavior as a result of computable causal chains, entails a vision of an automated subjectivity of machine intelligence.<sup>42</sup> The perfect algorithm following this ideology would replace
        all conscious cognition with a chain of automated reactions achieved by the pre-programmed prediction and manipulation of personal feelings, tastes and opinions.
        Compared to history, today’s computational systems are characterized by a new level of autonomy, in which they
        select, evaluate and make decisions without human super-vision. Algorithms analyze and compare options, run possible scenarios and perform reasoning through steps that were not implemented to the machine by humans. Like Parisi wrote: “The
        computational harnessing of chance is no longer carried out through an application of a pre-constituted formal logic. Instead, the algorithmic capture of uncertainty (i.e. unknown quantities of unpatterned data) involves the speed of
        nonconscious connection. This avoids the hierarchy of calculation and introduces an immediacy of decision able not only to forecast the future, but also to anticipate (and thus foreclose) chance.”<sup>43</sup>
        <br><br>
        What is fascinating about today’s algorithmic automation is that it largely uses patternless data and solves problems by using self-initiated steps. Between the input and the output, patternless information, noise and uncomputable units
        emerge, making the output larger than the input. The significance of the incomputables was recognized already in 1936 by Alan Turing , who is often seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence <b>figure20</b>.<sup>44</sup>
        What is noteworthy about this new form of algorithmic intelligence is that it doesn’t only set and perform tasks without human intervention, but also gives birth to a whole new realm of reasoning. Instead of using human-favored deductive
        logic, it uses uncomputable information and experimental truths as a central basis for reasoning.
        <br><br>
        From the unique characteristics of machine-to-machine communication and rule-based processing of infinite data a new dynamic logic is emerging, forming a mode of reasoning for the age of the algorithm. As Parisi put it: “Here reason does not
        follow the deductive model of thinking, for which truths are confirmed by conceptual explanations that trace problems to a predetermined cause. Instead, the model of reasoning is here characterized by the possibility of generating hypotheses
        that discover the best possible explanation and revise set parameters according to circumstances.”<sup>45</sup>
        <br><br>
        Computation restructures and frames our abilities to socialize, learn, create and develop new cognitive capabilities. Affect, emotion, knowledge, thinking, beliefs and desires have become important parameters in extracting value out of human
        interaction with technology. Sensual and emotional experiences are processed as data which is then traded and finally marketed back to the user as lucrative experiences and lifestyle choices. This production of social and cultural capital is
        largely engineered through social media. Human activity is not only measured and evaluated, but it is also directed towards preprogrammed outcomes. One could say that technocapitalism denies true desire, knowledge, reason and sensation since
        it reduces human interaction to automated cognitive and sensory responses.
        <br><br>
        Within these systems human cognition can operate below the level of self-awareness, where the most primitive cognitive mechanisms for thinking, remembering and speaking have a root in bodily perceptions and affections. The capabilities of
        nonconscious cognition are activated to execute actions at a speed that is not accessed by the conscious order of logic. Since networked media has penetrated our precognitive neurological systems, technology will soon if not already now know
        what we want to think, where we want to go and what we want to purchase before we do.

      Hypoconnectivist Manifesto
    </div>
    <div class="zoom-section text inner-shadow">
      <p class="script">We have entered an era of intangible human traffic,<br>
        where instead of trading our flesh and our muscle power,<br>
        Our digital selves are freely <br>sold and bought on the market.<br>
        Credit card purchases, financial records, <br>employment history, cell phone location,<br>
        medical tests and prescriptions, topics of interest, <br>browsing history and social media activity<br>
        all up for grabs at a bargain deal.<br>
        Millions are being made in the data broker trade,<br>
        But all we get is free entertainment and an Instagram reel.<br>
        Who gave you the permission <br>to commercialize the digital me?<br>
        Shouldn’t the ownership of one’s personal data <br>be a basic human right?<br>
        <br>
        It seems with great power comes no responsibility.<br>
        Addictive technology is stealing our focus, <br>our sleep and our autonomy.<br>
        I’m tired of parenting myself <br>like a kid with attention deficiency.<br>
        So please, ban the behavioral nudges, <br>the neuromarketing and the microtargeting,<br>
        The opinion-confirming echo chambers, <br>the history-repeating recommendations.<br>
        Ban unfair competition, asymmetrical power and monopolies<br>
        that will otherwise lead to economic totalitarian regime.<br>
        And tax the tech giants <br>based on how much harm they cost on society,<br>
        amplifying hate speech, <br>fake news and diminishing productivity.<br>
        Like medicine, why doesn’t technology need to prove <br>its safety and efficacy?<br>
        By applying AI-amplified human error <br>into the power structures of authority<br>
        Institutional racism, oppression <br>and inequality will continue to roam free.<br>
        <br><br>
        I’m tired of spaces of normalized corporate design,<br>
        And people everywhere conditioned to have identical minds.<br>
        We need a new army of hacktivists,<br>
        So that alternative expressions can persist<br>
        And maybe through artistic intervention,<br>
        Our mind can finally recondition.<br>
        <br><br>
        Your algorithms assume that the future is like the past,<br>
        But I dare disagree.<br>
        We all have the power to break ourselves free<br>
        Since we’re all equipped with brain plasticity,<br>
        And by training methods of focus and mindfulness<br>
        We can perhaps cure the mind’s dullness<br>
        and reclaim our long-lost agency.<br>
        I dare all of you to protest with some proper deep sleep<br>
        To enter a rare state of noncommercial being<br>
        To reclaim your right to think, feel and dream.<br>
        And embrace the taboos of boredom, <br>unproductivity and inefficiency,<br>
        To decolonize your mind <br>from the grasp of the attention economy.<br>

      Demand For Change
    </div>
    <div class="zoom-section text inner-shadow">
      <p>In the past few decades we have witnessed a tremendous digital disruption throughout society. It has changed the way we behave, how our work is valued and how our society functions. It has subjugated us under constant surveillance without a
        realistic option to opt out. Algorithmic thinking has disrupted all industries, while undermining our understanding of the ruling mechanisms of society. While the complexity of global systems grows, we dive deeper and deeper into our
        personalized online echo chambers, where it becomes harder and harder to understand how other people experience of the world. A population of unawaringly biased people makes the functioning of an informed democracy increasingly difficult.
        Instead of connecting people, we have come to witness how social media and its filter bubbles have the capacity to tear society apart.
        <br><br>
        Less and less people even among AI professionals understand why the machine thinks the way it does, coming to conclusions never-before imagined by humans. Despite increasingly sophisticated systems of computation, we are no closer to truly
        understanding how machine learning algorithms do what they do — we can only judge their results. Day by day, we give more and more autonomy and decision-making power to the machine while diminishing our own agency in the process. We’re
        fascinated by the nearly mystical, almighty power of algorithmic intelligence that we cannot fully comprehend, worshipping it as an omnipotent solution to all questions of humanity. The morally neutral machine has begun to increasingly define
        and categorize the world we live in, efficiently executing tasks while being unable to consider the moral implications or long-term consequences of its actions. With the mission of maximizing user engagement, AI often floods our feeds with
        radical opinions, hate speech and conspiracy theories. AI doesn’t care what’s real or fake. For now, all it cares about is clicks and the time we spend online.
        <br><br>
        But it is not that the AI or its makers are somehow evil, it is just that we have allowed harmful business models to harness our attention for the generation of profit. By deliberately deploying learnings from behavioral psychology to develop
        addictive behavior, tech companies have turned the odds against the future of humanity. Still, in the pressure of eternal growth within the competitive capitalist environment one cannot really blame an individual company for trying to
        maximize its profits. Rather, we should try to reassess our economical, technological, political, philosophical and environmental values at large and revise their suitability for our current times. Luckily, things don’t need to go down this
        path until eternity. Since the main issues lie within the predatory business models and the lack of regulation, it is perfectly possible to update the rules of the game to better fit our current world.
        <br><br>
        Even if life within attention economy can often feel overpowering, every individual action makes a difference. If everyone protested by switching off from social media just for one day per week, we could significantly decrease the economical
        power of data monopolies and at the same time improve our mental health. But there’s only so much one can do as an individual. Only by fixing the problem from the root can we truly decolonize our brains from the grasp of the attention
        economy. This would mean introducing increased regulation and taxation of the tech industry, alongside with changing their business models and their financial incentives. In the end the commercial algorithms are creating the greatest issues,
        so as consumers we have the power the demand for change. Everyone loves a free service, but in the end a small subscription fee is maybe not such a bad price to pay for one’s autonomy.
