        The online world has become a global universal medium for nearly all information we consume (for internet usage statistics, see Figures 1–4). It has subsumed previous technological advancements such as television, radio, printing press, mail,
        weather forecast, clock, calculator any other thinkable technology of the not-so-distant past. These individual technologies are now consumed in a layered, unified environment of open windows, digital chimes, blinking ads and popping
        notifications. Since information online is often compressed and designed to be as attention-grabbing, clickable and shareable as possible, our brain also learns to absorb it in a different way — quickly, superficially and horizontally. This
        crucial relationship between the medium and the message was already introduced by Marshall McLuhan in his seminal text “Medium Is The Message” (McLuhan 1). Due to the ubiquity of portable smart devices and internet-of-things (IoT) in our
        homes and public spaces, the algorithmic way of experiencing the world becomes ever more prevalent. We increasingly externalize our thinking and decision-making power to the computer, gradually making the uncomputable the unthinkable,
        hindering our imagination beyond the realm of computation.
        <br><br>
        Over the past years I have become increasingly aware of the alienating effects of a hyperconnected life on the mind. Like a computer infected by a virus, thoughts enter the awareness like unwanted popups, flooding the operation system with
        constant interruptions. It’s like someone has been messing with the mind’s system preferences making the interface harder and harder to operate. The back-end of the mind is rendered opaque, while the front-end is coded incomprehensible. The
        routing of the brain gets more and more complex since it constantly connects to an increasing amount of networks, devices and communication channels. Floating on the surface of this ungraspable network, the disoriented and hyperstimulated
        brain often resorts to the reactions of the so-called “lizard brain,” that governs functions such as primitive emotional responses, habit-formation, fighting, fleeing, feeding and reproduction (Komninos).
        <br><br>
        Processing the continuous flow of requests, alerts and reminders at maximum power, the mind can at its best enter a temporary sleep mode, but is never truly allowed to shut down (see Figure 5). The distinction between work and leisure, fact
        and fiction, dreams and reality becomes ever more obsolete in the age of persuasive artificial intelligence (AI), fake news and deepfakes. Like being attached to the strings of a puppeteer, our thoughts, emotions and actions are being
        sophisticatedly tailored into the needs of neoliberal capitalism. In the name of profit and efficiency, the morally neutral AIs sow polarized views, disinformation, hate speech and primitive emotions in society, while harvesting our time and
        attention for the economic benefit of a few multinational corporations and increasing financial inequality across the globe. International data monopolies have become one of the most powerful institutions of the world, holding significant
        bio- and neuropower over global populations.
        <br><br>
        Together the five American tech giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Inc., Microsoft and Facebook earn almost the total gross-domestic product (GDP) of Netherlands, leaving behind other rich countries like Switzerland and Saudi Arabia, making them
        economically more powerful than most nations of the world (“Most Valuable Companies In The World – 2020”).
        <br><br>
        The idea that our thoughts, feelings and desires could be controlled without our awareness used to sound like science fiction. Today, it has become a reality, backed up with a body of research claiming that machine intelligence affects human
        decision-making beyond the level of self-awareness. The more sophisticated our machine learning algorithms become, the less we understand how they really work. What we do know, is that the reasoning of the machine greatly differs from that of
        humans.
        <br><br>
        My own awakening to the issues of attention economy was ignited during my university studies in business and economics, where I completed a bachelor’s degree in Business Technology and a master’s degree in Information and Service Management.
        Questions related to information technology and economics followed me into my creative practice and eventually inspired me to write this thesis. I wanted compare my personal experiences of living within attention economy to the existing body
        of research relating to its effects on society and the individual. Triggered by my own experiences, I set out to investigate what exactly is going on in our hyperconnected minds and paralyzed bodies. I wanted to understand what embedded
        values and working mechanisms are hidden behind the slick user interface screens. I hoped to discover ways to decolonize the brain from the grasp of the attention economy and to find out if there’s a way to realign the goals of technology
        with the goals of human life.

      <p class="sticky-heading">1.2 Affects of a Hyperconnected Lifestyle on an Individual</p>
      <br>
      Most of us have at least occasionally felt overwhelmed by life in the 21st century attention economy. Attention economy refers to the current state of the economy, where companies are increasingly competing for users’ attention, which has
      become the most valuable resource of the digital age (Mintzer). In today’s society information is abundant, but attention is scarce, which makes the modern economy increasingly revolve around the human attention span. Companies spend increasing
      efforts in finding ways how to best capture our attention for the generation of profit. An apt visualization of the complexities of living in the age of attention economy and social media can be seen in the film “Possessed,” directed Metahaven
      and Rob Schröder (see Figure 6).
      <br><br>
      The hyperconnected lifestyle results in a lack of focus, rest and self-awareness while the mind resorts to a whirlwind of superficial thinking — favoring speed over contemplation, broadness over depth and simplicity over complexity. Behavior
      often seems to be dictated by subconscious compulsive urges instead of considerate, mindful actions. Technology used to be our tool, but it’s now our environment. It’s our identity and self-value, our knowledge and memory, our work and our
      leisure, our dream and our nightmare.
      <br><br>
      It’s a constant love-hate relationship, where the platforms that bring us visibility, work and valuable contacts also distract us every minute of the day. The online world makes it terribly easy to drift away by meaningless entertainment,
      providing a steady flow of shockingly accurate personalized content, hitting the sweet spot of our most private desires. And while it occasionally produces feelings of success and self-validation, it also produces the most intense feelings of
      failure, loneliness and anxiety, leaving us confused of what exactly feels off. It’s a constant ping-pong match between emotional extremes, where our attention, mood and behavior are tossed around by forces that we seem to have little control
      of.
      <br><br>
      We feel the need to stay connected in order to prove our position in the world, since not participating feels like not fully existing. We escape our fear of being “out” by trying to constantly keep up with global trends and flows of
      information, but it is precisely this fear that keeps us logging in and scrolling until eternity, preventing us from standing still and observing our behavior from an outside perspective. But one can never keep up since by design,
      hyperconnectedness makes us feel on the verge of dropping out. The detrimental role of social media for mental health has been much explored in pop culture, such as in the semi-autobiographical television series “I May Destroy You” (2020) by
      Michaela Coel (see Figure 7) and the biographical documentary “This Is Paris” (2020) by Paris Hilton (see Figure 8).
      <br><br>
      The hyperconnected lifestyle extends itself also beyond mindless social media scrolling. Being the perfect example of a 21st century international freelancer, I operate between multiple countries, time-zones and industries, with a majority of
      my work being initiated and executed in or via an online environment. The gig economy has made working contracts and conditions flexible but at the same time precarious. Workers are increasingly expected to be always on call waiting for the
      next assignment, working globally on multiple time zones without fixed working hours, creating a “24/7 work-day” (Crary 33).
      <br><br>
      The experience of time becomes almost “instantaneous,” consisting of inconceivably brief and fragmented instants where the fast-paced, non-linear social and technological relationships replace the linear logic of clock-time (Urry 137). Sense of
      time and space mend into an nonrhythmic pulsation where on one end huge chunks of time are getting sucked into online wormholes, and on the other end time slows down in the moments of insomnia or in the face of a focus-intensive task such as
      in-depth reading or writing.
      <br><br>
      Like Pascal Gielen aptly described: “In a corporate world, society is losing its time to dig deep. Not obstinacy, stubbornness and steadfastness, but adaptability, flexibility and mobility allow people to survive in a global network
      configuration. Today, we have to take the witticism ‘Time is Money’ literally. Time is no longer determined by a place or a local polis, but by virtual money flows which stream in high speed around the globe. This leads to the speeding-up of
      fast changing connections, in which we not only lose depth, but also height. Consequently, having ‘no time’ means that you don’t have the time to stand still by yourself. Time for (self)reflectivity is shrinking, also the time to stand above
      yourself, looking at yourself while you operate in the world” (195-196).
      <br><br>
      In the competition of everyday life, consideration of the long-term consequences of one’s actions gets pushed to the back of the mind. People are forced into a situation where they are responsible only for themselves and their own survival. The
      responsibility for one’s immediate environment and social context simply becomes dysfunctional for one must continuously move, either mentally or physically, in order to survive. The rare occasion of simply doing nothing results in anxiety,
      boredom and restlessness, since every waking moment feels like another opportunity for personal development.
      <br><br>
      With part-time and freelance employment on the rise, the labile working culture makes individuals disengaged from solidarity structures and makes it difficult for them to stand up for their rights for humane working conditions. In an economy
      where attention is the most valuable asset, the freelancer is often forced to exchange work for mere exposure. These freelancers and other post-Fordist workers have to resort to short-term thinking, as they are obliged to quickly, flexibly and
      opportunistically anticipate the constantly changing and unpredictable working environment. This makes the neoliberal freelancer fall on the mercy of the here-and-now, making it impossible to attain any long-term perspective.

      <p class="sticky-heading">1.3 The biggest psychological experiment ever run on humanity</p>
      <br>
      I believe our dogmatic belief in free human will might be the biggest mistake we are making in the 21st century. We are a society stuck on an outdated 18th century Enlightenment philosophy, where “free” human will was seen as the source of all
      truth. In the light of new science, we know how the most primitive parts of our brain can be effectively persuaded to act on a pre-programmed impulse (Harari 16). Since our impulsive reactions ignite deep in the brain below the surface our
      cognition, we are mostly unaware of our behavior being manipulated.
      <br><br>
      The new persuasive technologies have raised a concern of how they will affect our thinking, our attentional capacities, our emotions and our behavior. 40 years from the popularisation of the personal computer and 13 years from the release of
      the first iPhone, we are now living in the midst of a transformation comparable to the magnitude of the industrial revolution. The information revolution has demonstrated its immense power of shaping our lives and our minds. Due to the great
      freedom and power of the tech companies combined with little regulation, the information revolution has become the most extensive psychological experiment ever run on humanity. Attention-grabbing persuasive technology is creating an
      unprecedented force of bio- and psychopower that neurologically captures an entire generation’s attention through the means of neuromarketing that aims to interfere with the consumers’ decision-making processes (see Figure 9).
      <br><br>
      Before shifting up our gears to the next level of machine intelligence and automated cognition, it’s of utmost urgency to investigate our current relationship with technology. The hazardous business models must be eliminated in order to steer
      away from the abusive path we have recently strayed upon. Regaining agency in our decision-making processes, remastering our focus and rediscovering values beyond eternal growth, efficiency and productivity must become the main goals of
      society.
